# Blinkit: A Comprehensive Analysis

Blinkit is an Indian quick-commerce and online grocery delivery service that aims to provide essentials to customers within minutes. Formerly known as Grofers, Blinkit rebranded in 2021 to focus on rapid delivery, leveraging a network of local dark stores and warehouses in high-demand areas. With a mobile-friendly platform, it offers a wide range of products, including groceries, household items and personal care essentials, catering to urban customers' needs for convenience and quick access to daily necessities.

## Project Overview:
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of Blinkit's sales performance across various outlets, item types and regions. Key metrics such as total sales, average sales, number of items and average rating are prominently displayed, giving a snapshot of overall business performance. The dashboard also breaks down sales by outlet size, fat content and outlet type, enabling a detailed understanding of which product categories and outlet locations drive the highest sales. Visual trends in outlet establishment growth, item visibility and distribution of fat content in products help identify areas with potential for improvement or targeted sales initiatives.

The Primary objective of this project is to analyze Blinkit Grocery Data, to determine the following:

1) Total Sales by Fat Content: (Donut Chart)
    Analyzed total sales categorized by fat content to identify product preference trends.
2) Total Sales by Item Type: (Bar Chart)
    Assessed sales performance across different item types.
3) Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales: (Stacked Chart)
    Examined total sales based on fat content across different outlets.
4) Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year: (Line Chart)
    Analyzed sales in relation to outlet establishment years to observe growth trends.
5) Sales by Outlet Size:  (Pie Chart)
    Compared total sales by outlet sizes (e.g., Teir 1 ,Teir 2, Teir 3).
6) Sales by Outlet Location:  (Funnel Map)
    Investigated sales distribution across various locations.
7) All Metrics by Outlet Type:  (Matrix Card)
    Conducted a comprehensive analysis of all metrics based on outlet type to identify high-performing categories.


 ## Key Analysis 
Based on the dashboard insights:
Sales in perspectivly 

- Outlet Type Focus: The highest sales are from "Supermarket Type1" outlets, which contribute around $787.55K. Focusing on this outlet type, particularly by enhancing product variety and availability, can help increase sales further. Grocery stores also have a high potential for growth with proper targeting, as they account for $151.94K in sales but might benefit from increased inventory or promotional efforts.

- Product Categories: Categories such as "Fruits and Vegetables" and "Snack Foods" show promising sales figures ($0.18M each), suggesting that these categories could be expanded or promoted more actively. Consider bundling offers or targeted promotions for these high-demand items.

- Tier 3 Locations: Outlets in Tier 3 locations show the highest sales ($472.13K), indicating strong demand. Additional outlets or more marketing efforts in these regions could amplify growth. Tier 2 and Tier 1 areas, while less profitable than Tier 3, could benefit from tailored promotional strategies to increase engagement and sales.

- High-Fat Content Products: Products with regular fat content significantly outperform low-fat options, generating $776.32K in sales compared to $425.36K. This insight suggests a preference for regular fat items, which could be leveraged by stocking popular regular-fat items in larger quantities.
  
- Grocery Store Sales Focus: Although grocery stores are not the top-performing outlet type, they still contribute significantly with $151.94K in total sales.

  ## Insights
- To increase revenue from grocery stores, consider strategies like:
- Expanding Product Variety: Adding more high-demand items like fruits, vegetables, and snack foods.
- Localized Promotions: Offering discounts or loyalty rewards specifically in areas where grocery store outlets are located, especially in Tier 3 regions.
- Enhanced Visibility: Improving in-store and online product displays to increase item visibility, especially for top-selling categories.
